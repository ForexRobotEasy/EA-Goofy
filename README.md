# EA Goofy - Trading Robot for XAUUSD (Gold) Commodities

## Product Description
EA Goofy is a trading robot specifically designed for trading XAUUSD (Gold) commodities. It is developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team, a trusted provider of automated trading solutions. This EA aims to optimize XAUUSD trading by implementing intelligent algorithms and advanced trading strategies.

With EA Goofy, you can choose between two trading modes: Aggressive and Conservative. The trading mode is determined based on your account type. If you have an ACCOUNT_CENT or ACCOUNT_STANDARD type, the robot will operate in the Aggressive mode, otherwise, it will switch to the Conservative mode.

In the Aggressive mode, the minimum deposit requirement is 1500. If your account balance falls below this threshold, the robot will automatically switch to the Conservative mode and adjust the timeframe to H4.

EA Goofy utilizes intelligent algorithms to identify trend reversals and filter out market noise for improved trading performance. It generates entry and exit signals based on the intelligent algorithm's analysis and executes trades accordingly.

The robot is equipped with a trade execution module that handles the actual buying and selling of XAUUSD commodities based on the generated signals.

## Code Explanation

### Libraries
The necessary libraries are included using the `#include` directive.

### Trading Modes
The trading modes are defined using an enum called `TradingMode`. The two modes available are AGGRESSIVE and CONSERVATIVE.

### Global Variables
The global variables `minimumDeposit`, `timeframe`, and `tradingMode` are declared. `minimumDeposit` represents the minimum account balance required for the Aggressive mode. `timeframe` represents the selected timeframe for trading, and `tradingMode` stores the current trading mode.

### Trading Functions
The trading functions are initialized using the `CTrade` class.

### OnInit()
The `OnInit()` function is called during the initialization of the EA. It sets the trading mode and timeframe based on the account type. If the account type is ACCOUNT_CENT or ACCOUNT_STANDARD, the trading mode is set to AGGRESSIVE and the timeframe is set to M15. Otherwise, it sets the trading mode to CONSERVATIVE and the timeframe to H4. The trading mode and timeframe are then printed in the Terminal.

### OnTick()
The `OnTick()` function is called on every tick. It performs various trade operations based on the selected trading mode.

If the trading mode is AGGRESSIVE and the account balance is less than the minimum deposit requirement, the robot switches to the CONSERVATIVE mode and adjusts the timeframe to H4. This is done to ensure that there is sufficient balance for aggressive trading.

The intelligent algorithm for identifying trend reversals and the market noise filter are not implemented in the provided code and should be added separately. The code comments indicate where these algorithms should be placed.

The entry and exit signals are generated based on the intelligent algorithm's analysis. Again, the code for signal generation is not provided and should be added separately.

Finally, the trades are executed based on the generated signals. The actual trade execution code is not provided and should be added separately.

Trade information is then printed in the Terminal to provide feedback on the executed trade.

### OptimizeStrategies()
The `OptimizeStrategies()` function is used to optimize the trading strategies for XAUUSD. The code for optimizing the strategies is not provided and should be added separately.

### OnDeinit()
The `OnDeinit()` function is called before termination and can be used to perform necessary cleanup operations. The code for cleanup operations is not provided and should be added separately.
